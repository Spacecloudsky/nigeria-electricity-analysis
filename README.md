# Nigeria Electricity Consumption & Billing Analysis

## üìä Overview
This project analyzes electricity consumption data in Nigeria with the goal of uncovering trends, consumer behaviors, and policy impacts. Using Python and data analytics tools, the project delivers actionable insights into billing accuracy, payment compliance, tariff performance, and meter status across various consumer segments.

## üìÅ Dataset Description
The dataset used in this analysis contains detailed electricity usage and billing records, including:
- **Customer profiles**
- **Consumption patterns**
- **Payment behavior**
- **Meter statuses**
- **Tariff band information**
- **Billing amounts and compliance records**

> üìå **Source**: Simulated/academic project dataset (for learning purposes)

## ‚ùì Key Research Questions
1. **Trend Analysis**  
   How has electricity consumption evolved over time?

2. **Consumer Profiling**  
   What are the usage patterns among different consumer types?

3. **Payment Behavior**  
   How compliant are consumers with their payments? What factors influence delays or defaults in payment?

4. **Meter Status Impact**  
   How do faulty or inactive meters affect consumption and billing accuracy?

5. **Tariff Effectiveness**  
   Are current tariff bands effective in promoting fairness and compliance?

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies
- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Time Series Analysis**
- **GroupBy, Pivot Tables, Aggregation**

## üìà Insights & Outcomes
- Consumption generally spikes during certain months(May to July and December to March), indicating seasonal patterns.
- Government consumers tend to have higher billing compliance despite lower electricity consumption.
- Customers with faulty meters often show abnormal billing records indicating bypass activity.
- Certain tariff bands disproportionately affect low-consumption households,in essence, tariff band is not proportional to the amount of electricity consumed. Proper monitoring and new regulations are encouraged.
- Visualization of trends helps flag discrepancies and inefficiencies in the current billing system.

## üí° Conclusion
This project offers a comprehensive look into electricity consumption and billing challenges in Nigeria. The findings can be used to support data-driven decisions in tariff design, energy policy, and customer service strategies.
